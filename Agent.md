VOIDE — North Star

Goal
Drag modules onto a canvas. Connect them with data-flow wires. Click Build and the system generates the internal connections exactly as laid out. Click Run to execute the designed flow and watch data move in real time, shown as activation lights on the canvas. Results can be retrieved from the last module or from any point in the flow.

Guiding rules

UI first: build canvas, menus, palette, wiring, modules, and buttons.

Backend second: only after UI is complete, connect each control to its function.

Add items only when needed: if not required now, it waits.

Every change must answer: does this help Build → Run → Watch flow?

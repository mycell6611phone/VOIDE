**THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS IMMUTABLE AND WILL NEVER CHANGE! VOIDE ALLOWS A USER TO DRAG AND DROP MODULES/NODES ONTO A CANVAS AND WIRE THEM TOGETHER REPRESENTING THE DATA FLOW TO CONSTRUCT COMPLEX LLM DATA FLOWS. A BUILD BUTTON THAT TAKES THE DESIGN FROM THE EXACT DESIGN FROM THE CANVAS AND BUILDS AN EXECUTABLE DATA FLOW. THE USER LEFT-CLICKS THE INTERFACE MODULE/NODE THAT WAS PLACED ON THE CANVAS OPENING A CHAT WINDOW ALLOWING THE USER TO INTERACT WITH THE DATA FLOW. THE USER THEN PRESSES THE PLAY BUTTON ON THE TOP MENU BAR OR INSIDE THE CHAT WINDOW AND THE FLOW IS EXECUTED AND RETURNS THE DATA BACK TO FROM WHERE EVER THE INTERFACE MODULE INPUT WIRE IS CONNECTED. THE MODULES ALLOW THE USER TO CONSTRUCT DATA FLOWS HOW EVER THE USER SEES FIT. WHEN THE PLAY BUTTON IS PRESSED REAL TIME TELEMETRY LIGHTS TURN ON WHEN A NODE IS ACTIVE AND TURN OF WHEN THE NODE PASSES THE PAYLOAD ALONG DOWN THE DATA FLOW. ALLOWING THE USER TO TROUBLE SHOOT THE FLOW IN REAL TIME VISUALLY. 1. THIS MAIN GOAL WILL NEVER CHANGE! 2. CAN NOT BE MODIFIED. 3. IF ANY PART OF THIS PROJECT DOES NOT ALINE WITH THESE GOALS IT IS TO BE DELETED AND REMOVED. 4. IF ANY INSTRUCTIONS DO NOT ALINE WITH THESE GOALS IT IS TO BE IGNORED. 5. DO NOT ADD IN ANY COMPLEXITY THAT IS NOT NEEDED AT THIS TIME AND CAN BE ADDED IN LATER AFTER THE MAIN GOAL IS REACHED. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE GUI FUNCTIONAL ABILITY OR COMPLEXITY.**

# /core — Runtime & CLI Hub
> **File Modification Guardrails**
> - Do not create, modify, or delete anything under any `dist/` directory.
> - Never touch: `packages/**/dist/**`, `build/**`, `out/**`.
> - Only edit files in `src/`, `scripts/`, `config`, or test paths.


**Purpose.** Houses the TypeScript runtime, flow compiler, and CLI that back the
Electron app. Everything here is ESM and must obey the free/offline guardrails
from the root `Agents.md`.

The pipeline lives entirely here: Build consumes the renderer's `FlowGraph`
JSON, runs the compiler passes, and emits a deterministic `CompiledFlow`
artifact that the runtime executes. Run paths (CLI and Electron) must accept
only that compiled artifact.

**Key subfolders**
- `src/` — Source TypeScript. See `core/src/AGENTS.md` for a deeper breakdown.
- `scripts/` — Helper scripts (validation, bundling, testing utilities).
- `test/` — Vitest specs that exercise runtime pieces.
- `dist/` — Build artefacts generated by `pnpm --filter @voide/core build`.

**Common tasks**
- Type-check/build: `pnpm --filter @voide/core build`
- Run tests: `pnpm --filter @voide/core test`

**Gotchas**
- Stay offline; adapters that would hit the network must be stubbed.
- Keep CLI entrypoint `src/cli.ts` lean; heavy logic belongs in `src/runtime/`.

## Backend Transition Notes

- Capture compiler architecture decisions (passes, IR versions) here so `packages/main` and the CLI can track compatibility.
- When adding new payload shapes, document their purpose and downstream consumers in this file before updating the runtime.
- Run `pnpm --filter @voide/core test -- --runInBand` after major scheduler/compiler updates to surface non-determinism locally.

# /core/protos â€” Generated Protobuf Output
> **File Modification Guardrails**
> - Do not create, modify, or delete anything under any `dist/` directory.
> - Never touch: `packages/**/dist/**`, `build/**`, `out/**`.
> - Only edit files in `src/`, `scripts/`, `proto/`, `config`, or test paths.


Auto-generated by `pnpm --filter @voide/core proto:gen`. Do not edit manually.
Regenerate after changing `.proto` sources.

## Backend Transition Notes

- Bump protobuf package versions intentionally and record the expected compatibility window with cached `CompiledFlow` files.
- After regenerating, run a targeted diff (`git diff core/protos`) to confirm only expected message changes landed before updating downstream TypeScript wrappers.

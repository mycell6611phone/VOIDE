# /core/src/nodes â€” Node Catalog

Defines built-in node metadata surfaced to the UI and compiler. Keep entries in
`builtins.ts` synchronized with renderer palettes and module manifests.

## Backend Transition Notes

- Document new node capabilities (loop support, concurrency hints) here so the compiler/orchestrator can rely on them during Build planning.
- Whenever a node requires backend-only adapters or services, note the dependency here and update `packages/main/src/services` docs accordingly.

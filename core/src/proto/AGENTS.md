> **File Modification Guardrails**
> - Do not create, modify, or delete anything under any `dist/` directory.
> - Never touch: `packages/**/dist/**`, `build/**`, `out/**`.
> - Only edit files in `src/`, `scripts/`, `proto/`, `config`, or test paths.


TypeScript helpers around generated protobuf classes. Sync with `core/protos`.
Do not commit manual edits to generated files; extend via wrapper utilities here.

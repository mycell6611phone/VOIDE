# /examples — Canvas Snapshots

Contains saved canvas JSON files that illustrate VOIDE flows. Useful for UI
demos and regression testing.

**Current files**
- `bulletizer.canvas.json` — Example flow layout referenced in docs.

**Guidelines**
- Keep examples small and anonymized.
- When adding new examples, document them in `ReadMe.txt` or relevant docs.
- Validate new flows with `pnpm voide validate` before committing.

# /packages/main/src/ipc â€” IPC Handlers
> **File Modification Guardrails**
> - Do not create, modify, or delete anything under any `dist/` directory.

> - Only edit files in `src/`, `scripts/`, `proto/`, `config`, or test paths.


Implements channel handlers for the main process. Validate payloads with
`@voide/ipc` before executing logic. Keep telemetry helpers in `telemetry.ts`
focused on in-memory lights events (no disk logging).

## Backend Transition Notes

- Separate Build handlers (compiler calls) from Run handlers (worker orchestration) so each can evolve independently and share minimal state.
- After creating a new handler, document the expected renderer/preload contract here and reference associated tests.

PRD: Visual IDE for LLM Workflow Builder

Focus: Top-Level User Interface

1. Overview

The Visual IDE is a drag-and-drop workflow builder for constructing, testing, and exporting LLM-based architectures. It provides a canvas-based editor, module palette, wiring tool, and execution controls, enabling non-technical and technical users alike to design complex AI pipelines visually.

2. Goals

Enable intuitive drag-and-drop assembly of LLM workflows.

Provide interactive configuration menus for each module.

Allow testing, pausing, and stopping of workflows directly inside the IDE.

Support export/build of workflows into runnable or shareable formats.

3. Top-Level Interface Components
3.1 Canvas (Center Workspace)

Blank area where users place modules and draw connections.

Supports zoom/pan.

Visual wires represent data flow direction.

Visual indicators during execution show live data movement.

3.2 Top Menu Bar

Dropdown menus for global operations/settings.

Execution Controls (center):

Start → run current workflow.

Pause → suspend execution, preserve state.

Stop → terminate execution completely.

Build Button (right):

Compiles current workflow into a structured output format (e.g., JSON/YAML or runnable script).

3.3 Left Side Menu (Module Palette)

Contains categories of drag-and-drop modules:

LLMs (GPT, LLaMA, Gemini, etc.)

Prompt Modules

Loop/Iteration Modules

Memory/Cache

Tools/APIs

Wiring tool

4. Module Interaction
4.1 Placement

Drag modules from side menu to canvas.

4.2 Connection

Wiring tool draws arrows between modules to establish data flow.

Supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and feedback loops.

4.3 Configuration Menus (Right-Click on Module)

Each module has a context menu with pre-built options:

LLM Module

Dropdown: list of available models (GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemini, etc.)

Options: weights, input/output formats, communication methods.

Help menu: definitions and usage tips.

Prompt Module

Text field for writing a custom prompt.

Preloaded prompt examples to choose from.

Help menu: guidance on structuring effective prompts.

Tools Module

List of tools (calculator, API connector, search, etc.).

Toggle on/off per tool.

Help menu: usage definitions.

5. Execution Features

Run workflows in real time within IDE.

Data flow animations across wires.

Debug overlays (optional in future version).

6. Build & Export

Clicking Build outputs the workflow into:

JSON / YAML graph of modules and wiring.

Code template (future feature).

Output contains all module configurations and links.

7. Non-Goals (for this PRD scope)

Low-level model execution (beyond mock/test mode).

Deployment pipelines.

Collaboration features.

Summary:
This top-level UI provides a canvas editor with menus, drag-and-drop modules, execution controls, and right-click configuration menus for modules. The goal is to make complex LLM workflows visually designable, testable, and exportable with minimal manual coding.
